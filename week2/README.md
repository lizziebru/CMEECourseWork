## **Week 2 Repository**

This repository contains all coursework materials from week 2 of practical work in the CMEE course.

Specifically, this includes the [**Biological Computing in Python I**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/05-Python_I.html#) chapter in the Computing module of the  [**The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html) online book.


### **Languages**

Python 3.8.10


### **Dependencies** 

No special packages are required to run this project.


### **Installation**

If you would like to run the scripts in this project, you should clone this repository.


### **Usage**

[**MyExampleScript.py**](code/MyExampleScript.py)

This is an example python script with an example of how to define and call a function. It takes no arguments and should be run in one go, producing a function and example output of that function.


[**align_seqs.py**](code/align_seqs.py)

This script aligns two DNA sequences such that they are as similar as possible. It should be run altogether, taking an input from the [data](data) directory and outputting a text file with the best alignment and corresponding score into the [results](results) directory.


[**align_seqs_better.py**](code/align_seqs_better.py)

This groupwork script takes any two fasta sequences (in separate files) to be aligned as input, taking into account all the equally-best alignments.


[**align_seqs_fasta.py**](code/align_seqs_fasta.py)

This groupwork script takes any two fasta sequences (in separate files) to be aligned as input.


[**basic_csv.py**](code/basic_csv.py)

This script demonstrates how to handle CSVs in python. It should be run in one go and open the data file [**testcsv.csv**](data/testcsv.csv) and write another file called bodymass.csv.


[**basic_io1.py**](code/basic_io1.py)

This script demonstrates how to input files in python. It should be run in one go and open an example text file [**test.txt**](data/test.txt).


[**basic_io2.py**](code/basic_io2.py)

This script demonstrates how to output files in python. It should be run in one go and output a file called testout.txt to the results directory.


[**basic_io3.py**](code/basic_io3.py)

This script demonstrates how to store files in python. It should be run in one go and open and store the contents of the file [**test.txt**](data/test.txt).


[**boilerplate.py**](code/boilerplate.py)

This is a boilerplate script for python programs. It should be run in one go and demonstrate how to define a main function as the main entry point of a program and store it before exiting.


[**cfexercises1.py**](code/cfexercises.py)

This script contains some functions exemplifying the use of conditionals. It should be run altogether, writing the six functions and printing the results of the test argument for each function.


[**cfexercises2.py**](code/cfexercises2.py)

This script contains examples of loops and conditionals in python. It should be run in one go and print 'hello' multiple times as it runs through the loops.


[**control_flow.py**](code/control_flow.py)

This script contains functions exemplifying the use of control statements in python. It should be run in one go and define and test some functions.


[**debugme.py**](code/debugme.py)

This script demonstrates debugging in python. It should be run in one go and define and test a functon which prints an error message if part of it fails.


[**dictionary.py**](code/dictionary.py)

This script makes a dictionary from tuples. It should be run altogether and return a dictionary which maps order names to sets of taxa.


[**lc1.py**](code/lc1.py)

This script contains two exercises on practicing list comprehensions and loops. It should be run altogether and print the latin names, common names, and mean body masses for each bird species two times.


[**lc2.py**](code/lc2.py)

This script contains three more exercises on practicing list comprehensions and loops. It should be run altogether and print the following lists two times:
- a list of month/rainfall tuples where the amount of rain was greater than 100mm
- a list of just month names where the amount of rain was less than 50mm


[**loops.py**](code/loops.py)

This script contains examples of loops in python. It should be fun in one go and print some outputs of the example loops.


[**oaks.py**](code/oaks.py)

This script contains a worked example of using loops and list comprehensions. It should be run in one go and print some outputs of functions, loops, and list comprehensions defined in the script.


[**scope.py**](code/scope.py)

This script demonstrates variable scope in python. It should be run in one go and print variables defined locally and manipulated in a function defined in the script.


[**sysargv.py**](code/sysargv.py)

This script demonstrates what sys.argv is in python. It should be run in one go and print the name of the script, the number of its arguments, and the names of these arguments.


[**test_control_flow.py**](code/test_control_flow.py)

This script contains some functions exemplifying the use of control statements in python. It should be run in one go and define and print example outputs of a function.


[**tuple.py**](code/tuple.py)

This script demonstrates how to separate a tuple of tuples into separate lines. It should be run altogether and print each species' latin name, common name, and mass on separate lines.


[**using_name.py**](code/using_name.py)

This script demonstrates the use of the main module in python. It should be run in one go and print the name of the module of the program.
