## GENERAL NOTES ##

# PYTHON #

Loops vs list comprehensions
- stick with loops for complex algorithms etc
- but list comprehensions are numerically more efficient - e.g. good to use for tuples stuff

Global variables
- best not to use - that way can avoid a lot of trouble


# BASH #

history | less
- v useful command

Use echo a lot
- it's v useful
