@ARTICLE{Ahmed2018-ni,
title = "pcr: an {R} package for quality assessment, analysis and testing
of {qPCR} data",
author = "Ahmed, Mahmoud and Kim, Deok Ryong",
abstract = "Background Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a broadly used
technique in the biomedical research. Currently, few different
analysis models are used to determine the quality of data and to
quantify the mRNA level across the experimental conditions.
Methods We developed an R package to implement methods for
quality assessment, analysis and testing qPCR data for
statistical significance. Double Delta CT and standard curve
models were implemented to quantify the relative expression of
target genes from CT in standard qPCR control-group experiments.
In addition, calculation of amplification efficiency and curves
from serial dilution qPCR experiments are used to assess the
quality of the data. Finally, two-group testing and linear
models were used to test for significance of the difference in
expression control groups and conditions of interest. Results
Using two datasets from qPCR experiments, we applied different
quality assessment, analysis and statistical testing in the pcr
package and compared the results to the original published
articles. The final relative expression values from the
different models, as well as the intermediary outputs, were
checked against the expected results in the original papers and
were found to be accurate and reliable. Conclusion The pcr
package provides an intuitive and unified interface for its main
functions to allow biologist to perform all necessary steps of
qPCR analysis and produce graphs in a uniform way.",
