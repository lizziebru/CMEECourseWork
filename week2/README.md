### **Dependencies** 

No special packages are required to run this project.


### **Installation**

If you would like to run the scripts in this project, you should clone this repository.


### **Usage**

[**lc1.py**](code/lc1.py)

This script contains two exercises on practicing list comprehensions and loops. It should be run altogether and print the latin names, common names, and mean body masses for each bird species two times.

[**lc2.py**](code/lc2.py)

This script contains three more exercises on practicing list comprehensions and loops. It should be run altogether and print the following lists two times:
- a list of month/rainfall tuples where the amount of rain was greater than 100mm
- a list of just month names where the amount of rain was less than 50mm

[**dictionary.py**](code/dictionary.py)

This script makes a dictionary from tuples. It should be run altogether and return a dictionary which maps order names to sets of taxa.

[**tuple.py**](code/tuple.py)

Thsi script demonstrates how to separate a tuple of tuples into separate lines. It should be run altogether and print each species' latin name, common name, and mass on separate lines.

[**cfexercises1.py**](code/cfexercises.py)

This script contains some functions exemplifying the use of conditionals. It should be run altogether, writing the six functions and printing the results of the test argument for each function.

[**align_seqs.py**](code/align_seqs.py)

This script aligns two DNA sequences such that they are as similar as possible. It should be run altogether, taking an input from the [data](data) directory and outputting a text file with the best alignment and corresponding score into the [results](results) directory.
