## **Week 1 Repository**

This repository contains all coursework materials from week 1 of practical work in the CMEE course.

Specifically, this includes the first four topics in the Computing module of the  [**The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html) online book:
1. [UNIX and Linux](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/01-Unix.html#)
2. [Shell scripting](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/02-ShellScripting.html)
3. [Version control with Git](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/03-Git.html)
4. [Scientific documents with LaTeX](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/04-LaTeX.html)

### **Languages**

BASH version 5.0.17(1)

TeX 3.14159265 (TeX Live 2019/Debian)

### **Dependencies** 

No special packages are required to run this project.


### **Installation**

If you would like to run the scripts in this project, you should clone this repository.


### **Usage**

1. [**UNIX and Linux**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/01-Unix.html#)

[**UnixPrac1.txt**](code/UnixPrac1.txt)

This file contains five standalone lines of UNIX shell commands that carry out  analysing sequence data from FASTA files provided in [**The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist Github repository**](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio).

 Each line should be run separately to generate their desired output, detailed in the accompanying comments.

2. [**Shell scripting**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/02-ShellScripting.html)

[**boilerplate.sh**](code/boilerplate.sh)

This script should be run altogether and print 'This is a shell script!'. It acts as a simple boilerplate for shell scripts.

[**tabtocsv.sh**](code/tabtocsv.sh)

This script substitutes the tabs in the file with commas and saves the output as a comma separated values file. It should be run with a tab delimited file as an argument. If a file is not provided it should throw and error message and exit.

[**variables.sh**](code/variables.sh)

This script illustrates the use of variables. It does not initially require arguments to run but asks for strings and numerical arguments once it is run.

[**MyExampleScript.sh**](code/MyExampleScript.sh)

This script demonstrates how values can be assigned using explicit declaration. It should be run as a full script with no arguments and output 
'Hello <user>
Hello <user>'.

[**CountLines.sh**](code/CountLines.sh)

This script counts the number of lines in a file. It should be run with one file as an argument and output the number of lines in it. If a file is not provided it should throw and error message and exit.

[**ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh**](code/ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh)

This script concatenates the contents of two files. It should be run with two files as arguments and output a concatenated file into the results directory. If two files are not provided it should throw and error message and exit.

[**tiff2png.sh**](code/tiff2png.sh)

This script should convert a .tif file to a .png file. It should be run with one .tif file as an argument. If a file is not provided it should throw and error message and exit.

3. [**Version control with Git**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/03-Git.html)

This practical is about how to push my repository to Github. No code files were made in this practical.

4. [**Scientific documents with LaTeX**](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/04-LaTeX.html)

[**CompileLaTeX.sh**](code/CompileLaTeX.sh)

This script should compile LaTeX with Bibtex. It should be run with one LaTeX file as an argument.
