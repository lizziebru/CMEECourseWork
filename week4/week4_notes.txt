## LECTURE ON FITING MODELS TO DATA IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION

# what is modelling?
- aims to explain processes/mechanisms underlying patterns/phenomena in empirical data 
- they have a theoretical basis - we know roughly how things should behave - based on physical principles
- models vs theory: theory = much more general (it's independent of specific phenomena)
- models establish the existence of statistically significant, non-random patterns or phenomena in empirical data
- they make no assumptions about the processes/mechanisms that generate the patterns (i.e. they lack a theoretical basis)


# mechanistic vs phenomenological models
- both play key role in bio
- phenomenological models reveal patterns in data that generate hypotheses
    - these can be tested using further model fitting
    - e.g. whether climatic temp affects the lynx-hare cycle]
- mechanistic: looks to validate a mechanistic model that can explain the pattern
    - i.e. generate more accurate, mechanistic hypotheses
- ultimately , successful epirically-grounded mechanistic models are the best path towards a theory in any scientfiic discipline

# roadmap:
- he likes to go bottom-up:
- mechanisms of indivs --> mechanisms of interactions --> mechanisms of communities


# most ecologcial studies perform phenomenological modelling 
-- bc need to forecast rather than explain
-- but big question: CAN WE FORECAST WITHOUT EXPLAINING??


# how to do it
- if possible use biological knowledge to construct models
- see if models agree well with data
- whicever one agrees best is likely to have teh right mechanisms
- that's the one thats best for predictions
- phenomological/statistical models often perform better than mechanistic oes - bc they often have less restrictive assumptions

# for miniproject:

- use least squares
- basically model selection is key
