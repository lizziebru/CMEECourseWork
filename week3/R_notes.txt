## DATA MANAGEMENT AND VISUALISATION

# --> p - value = what is the probability that i'm seeing this pattern by random chance

# PRACTICAL

# how to find out whether there's a correlation

#-- need to be careful to consider whether the points are independent from each other (partic problematic for time series data)
# ---> the pearson's correlation coefficient makes this assumption
# --> so instead you need to do something other than work out a correlation coefficient
# --> want to work out what a random correlation looks like --> use cor() - get a vector of time & temp - shuffles them then works out the correlation
# 1. calculate the correlation coefficient - but can't use the p value that R gives you - need to work out your own
# 2. need to calculate the asymptotic p value
# 3. find out what a random distribution looks like - and ask if yours is signifciantly different from the random correlation
# 4. what is the probability that you're observing this by pure chance?
# 5. to do this: divide the value by the number of times another value exceeds it (what is the probability that another value can be higher than that) (p-value = how many times does a random value exceed it)

## can vectorise it or not, can shuffle as many times as you want - basically just find a way to get that p-value

##^^ this is basically just a permutation test



## DATA WRANGLING

# really worth learning about databases - they're super important

# body sizes tend to be distributed in a strange way - so we normally take a log (bc they're usually distributed according to a log normal distribution)
