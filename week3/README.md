### **Usage**

[**TreeHeight.R**](code/TreeHeight.R)

This script calculates tree heights for trees provided. It should be run altogether and output the tree heights in a csv file. 


[**Vectorize2.R**](code/Vectorize2.R)

This script demonstrates vectorization in R. It should be run altogether and output the Ricker model in a vectorized way.


[**Florida.R**](code/Florida.R)

This script demonstrates how to carry out correlation coefficient analysis in R. It should be run altogether and output two PDF graphs of the results.


[**Florida_writeup.tex**](code/Florida.tex)

LaTeX write-up of the results of the analysis carried out in Florida.R.


[**DataWrangTidy.R**](code/DataWrangTidy.R)

This script demonstrates how to wrangle data in R using tidyr ad dplyr. It should be run altogether and wrangle the data it imports from the 'data' directory.


[**PP_Dists.R**](code/PP_Dists.R)

This script demonstrates how to visualize data in R. It should be run altogether and ouput three PDF files of plots as well as a CSV results file.


[**PP_Regress.R**](code/PP_Regress.R)

This script demonstrates how to visualize regression analyses in R. It should be run altogether and output a PDF file of a multi-faceted graph of the regressions and a CSV file containing the results of the regression analyses.


[**GPDD_Data.R**](code/GPDD_Data.R)

This script demonstrates how to map in R using the 'maps' package. It should be run altogether ad print a world map with locations from the provided GPDD dataframe superimposed onto it.
