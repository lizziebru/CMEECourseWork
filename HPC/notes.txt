## LECTURE 1: what is neutral theory?


kinda controversial
- v misunderstood

what is theory in the first place?
- conforms with empirical data and puts forward and explanation for observed phenomena

ecological theory: anything that's not in the field or in the lab: basically anything that uses maths/comuputers


ecological neutral theory: 
- assumes all indivs are ecologically equivalent - their fates are all the same
    --> NB: it's not a claim that all indivs ARE ecological relevant
    --> it's instead about making some assumptions and seeing where they get us
    --> this is a common use of deduction
- so ignores all the complexity around us
- an example of a simple individual-based model - i.e. components of the model are individuals

common misconceptions:
- the term neutral model = null model --> NOT TRUE!!
    - neutral models are a mechanistic model which can be used as null model but not necessarily
- neutral models assume that all species are the same --> NOT TRUE!!
    - they assume that all individuals are the same - not species!
    - ecological neutral theory assumes that the demographic properties (probability of birth, death, reproduction etc) of an individual are independent of its species identity
- there is another kind of model in which species are interchangeable --> called a neutral model


## LECTURE 2: EXAMPLE NEUTRAL models

the model rules:
- e.g. 16 squares with a diff indiv in each
- an indiv randomly dies
- their square will be filled at random with the seed of another indiv
- there's some competition which isn't explictly modelled
- but that seed fills that gap 
- occasionally also get speciation: new specie entering the system from outside

example early neutral model: Voter model (Holley & Liggett 1975)
- model of how political views spread throughout ppl
- how it works:
    - pick a random neighbour
    - take their view or they take yours
    - occasionaly someone introduces a new view
- sometimes you have the same view to begin with - still go through the same process but nothing changes
- sometimes someone introduces a new view too
- applying the voter model to biology:
    - political view becomes species identity
    - ppl become places in space where an indiv could live
    - dispersal is over v short distances - bc we historically would persuade ppl close by to us --> equivalent in bio is using reproduction where seeds don't disperse v far
- what we find from simulating voter models
    - there are some impenetrable clumps forming of indivs holding the same view / large clumps of single spp monodominance
    - tehre are edge effects: the behaviour of the model near the edge is diff from centre of a large area
    - without any new ideas being injected into the system, eventually everyone holds the same view

--> in biology: we call this the dynamic equilibrium: our community, filled with diff spp, has new spp arriving from speciation and spp going extinct at teh same time
        - ideally, speciation & extinction balance out so that spp richness remains constant throughout
        - equilibrium: balance between speciation & extinction
        - dynamic: the type of spp is always changing


variations on the theme of these neutral models
- i.e. tehre are tehrefore many diff neutral models, each making subtly diff assmptions/predictions
- e.g. the zero sum assumption:
    - indiv has to die before a new can be born
    - can relax this assumption though - indivs constantly dying and being born but these processes are roughly equal so total no. of indivs remains teh same with some fluctuations
- speciation mode - also variable
    - e.g. no speciation
    - e.g. speciation by point mutation where new indivs spontaneously form new spp
    - e.g. speciation by random fission: clumps of  indivs together form new spp e.g. like allopatric speciation
    - e.g. protracted speciation: happens over period of many years (not spontaneously)
- spatial structure of the system
    - e.g. non-spatial: everything is well mixed and its position in space doesn't affect the outcome of the model
    - e.g. spatially implicit: meta-community which is well-mixed and a smaller local community which is also well-mixed in itself but receives immigration from the metacomunity by dispersal
        - in metacommunity: balance btween extinction & speciation
        - lcoal community: balance between immigration & local extinction
    - e.g. spatially-explcit network: expansion of above into network of many diff patches (each of which is well-mixed in itself)
    - e.g. fully spatially explicit: where you have a dispersal kernel describing your probability of dispersing a seed or an offspring a certain distance away from your own position of birth
- most often studied neutral model: contains these assumptions:
    - relaxed zero sum assumption
    - no speciation
    - spatially implicit
    --> = Hubble 2001 neutral model

we will study these examples in our worksheet:
- relaxed zero sum assumption
- with or without speciation
- with no spatial structure


LECTURE 3: USES OF NEUTRAL THEORY 

neutral theory = gives you teh bare bone minimum model against which you can compare and upon which you can build
- can add dispersal limitations/other processes of speciation etc and see what happens when you add these as such

George Box qute: Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful
- they can all fail when being challenegd with real data
- they can be useful in helping us understand what's going on
- also helping us to predict either something that hasn't happened yet or something in a diff location that we haven't observed

How is ecological neutral theory useful for understanding?
- take data and challenge it with a model containing a mixture of processes that can be tweaked
- may have many diff competing models
- what if we find that many diff models explain the data equally well - often the case 
    - in this case maybe the neutral model wins or at east casts considerable doubt on the others bc it's much simpler (fewer assumptions etc) 
- can go through cycles of getting more data and revising models to make them explain the data better multiple times

example data comparison of species' abundance distributions:
- neutral model does better than lognormal model distribution - and its mechanistic too which is good
- BUT: mean spp lifetimes are too short - so we neeed a new model to explain the spp's lifetimes

point mutation speciation = speciation happens suddenly
protracted speciaton = speciation happens gradually


ecological neutral theory: how useful is it for predicting?
- can use models to make 2 types of predictions:
    - processes that mean something - mechanistic model (e.g. neutral theory - bc based on processes like birth/death which mean something ecologically)
    - phenomenological or pure stats - e.g. machine learning

there are lots of examples of making predictions from neutral models
- local spp richness:
