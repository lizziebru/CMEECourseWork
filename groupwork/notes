## GROUPWORK NOTES ##

# PYTHON I: Align DNA sequences I

Chalita has done this

The script should take 2 fasta sequences to align them
should also run a default sequence if you don't give it any inputs




# PYTHON I: Align DNA sequences II

Eamonn, Chalita & Emma have done this too

want to save all of the best alignments

make a dictionary and loop through both things

would be better to have less stuff in the main


TO DO:

add docstrings to all the functions
make everything generally more readable
look at both Chalita and Emma's solutions and see which one is better etc
Eamonn's soln to the second one: could try to figure out how to do it using a list instead --> cause he didn't end up using pickle (which necessitates using dictionaries)
basically just try refine Chalita & Eamonn and Emma's scripts



# PYTHON I: Missing oaks problem (to do at end of next week)



# R: Tree Heights I



# R: Tree Heights II



# R: Autocorrelation practical

wanna compare pairs of consecutive years

create one dataset: first year to the 99th year, then 2nd to the 100th year
--> then compare those



invest time in python ones!!
