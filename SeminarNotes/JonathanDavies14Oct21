Underground forests, fire, mammal browsers and the origins of African savanna

it's thought that the origin of savanna is connected w the origin of people

Biomes in S Africa:

Fynbos
- one of the many hyperdiverse biomes
- super diverse region 
- v small, hugely rich in genera 

Namib Desert
- conrasting biome
- v low diversity 
- some of the tallest sand dunes in the world

Grassland
- also resemble savanna landscapes
- different identity of flora

Indian Ocean Coastal Belt
- more forest & tree environ

Miombo Woodland
- thicket & shrubllike
- closest biome to the savanna biome

Savanna
- all over the place
- sporadic trees where threy're not dense enough to get rid of grass 
- so basically lots of trees & grass 
- major q: what allowed savanna to expand and separated it from other biomes?

Origins of savanna 
- it could support forests
- so there must be something to push the forest back

DNA barcoding the Trees of Africa
- initiative run by African CEntre for DNA barcoding
- across the plant tree of life: spp tend to have universal primers
- so you can recognise taxa to species or genus level
- University of Johannesberg
- what they included: woody plants, minimum height of 2m; permanent trunk; habits: tree, shrub, palm, cycad, tree fern, bamboo, arborescent succulent, climber
- so basically included anything that filled a tree-like role in the landscape
- made a cool tree of trees of Africa
- phylogenetic history of the SA flora: Daru et al 2015 --> used the tree to generate a new map of the biomes of S Africa based on phylogenetic relationships
--> nice to show that these biomes contain species that phylogenetically cluster together

But what about the origin of those biomes??
- can we do something more exciting with this phylogenetic info?
- they successively removed phylogeneic structure to identify the evo depth at which biomes collapse
- then they can see how the biomes collapse into each other
- 8-60my old - initial best guess
- climate = the usual explanation for changing vegetation - but doesn't match to the time of savanna spread
   --> maybe the shift was necessary? (change in CO2 levels) but doesn't by itself explain origin
- another possibility: fire? - pushing back the forest 
- or: grazers pushing back the forest 
- so 2 competing explanations: fire & grazers 
- both v good possibilities 
- but little evidence supporting both 
- so we have a v poor record of what were the ultimate drivers of savanna origin (no info on browser/fire intensity in fossil record)
- needed the decrease in co2 and c4 grass lineages - but needed a kickstart for the ecological expansion into savannah
- the "underground forests" of Africa (geoxylic suffrutex): inique spp where most of it is underground, but their sister lineages look like trees 
    -- only found in savannah grassland
    -- could use the age of these underground trees bc they require savanana to exist
    -- could maybe use these as markers for evidence of fire: bc their growth evolved in response to frequent fires & high ppt --> therefore maybe fire was one of the ecological forces that allowed that savanna expansion...?
- Cussonia arborea (south-central Africa) vs Cussonia corbisieri (Zambia - underground tree) = sister taxa
 -- the only thing that differentiates these is how tall they are - bc one's udnerground
- so using these underground trees can be useful and super cool!
    -- cool thing is that it showed it wasn't just one radiation: it happened multiple times idependently - so could do some stats
    -- did a bayseian reconstruction of the divergence times 
    -- x = geographic extent, y = age --> despite large uncertainty with ages, can see that there aren't any really old underground trees - most are 2-4my old and as you go south there's no evidence of old underground trees
    -- perhaps they originated in the equator and more recently evolved in the south
    -- so we might think that fire driving savanna originated in the equator then drove south

so in summary:
- necessary decrease in co2 favouring c4 photosynthetic pathway
- proliferation of c4 grasses
- then looking at age distribtion of underground trees - markers of fire-maintained savannas: so probs evolved around 2-10mya
--> this is much older than people!!
--> we weren't lighting fires then so it wasn't human-driven


What about mammal browsers?
- there are savannas where it's drier & they're not biomaintained
- so maybe browsers are the explanation here?
- need a proxy for browsing intensity: can we use the current evo & radiation of thorny lineages as a proxy for browser intensity?
- x = age, y = log(number of lineages): non spiny plant lineages vs spiny lineages: no spiny lineages up until 40mya (vs was a steady increase in non-spiny pant lineages) but then spiny plant lineages took off -- Charles-Dominique, Davies et al. 2016
    -- strong pressure for spiny to diversify 15-20mya - could maybe have been browsers?
    -- megafauna don't care about spines
    -- it's the bovids with their soft tender lips that are more sensitive
    -- so look at diversification of bovid lineages: they diversified massively fast at the same time as spiny plants diversified --> correlation strongly suggests that increased bovid lineages = increased browsing pressure = stopping regeneration of trees = grazin plains characterised by savanna and these browsers

herbivore-adapted savannas evolved several million years before fire-maintained savannas, and probs in diff conditions: in more arid, nutrient poor soils

similar type of biomes with 2 diff explnations: herbivore and browsers





What made this talk good
- went through things at the right pace 
- minimalist slides
- didn't use much jargon
- personal bits to it like talking about work w Vincent - made it relate to Imperial so tailored it to his audience well
- explained things well - tailored it to audience who don't know much about genetics - but didn't sound patronising either
